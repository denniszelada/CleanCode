# Meaningful Names

The names should reflect the intention, choosing good names takes time but saves
more than it takes.

The name should reveal it's intent and answer the question:
  1. Why exist?
  2. What it does?
  3. How it is used?

Avoid spelling similar concepts using inconsistent spelling, instead spell it
similarly.
